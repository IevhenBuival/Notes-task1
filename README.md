### Hi, this is Task-1 on vanilla js + bootstrap

link:
https://ievhenbuival.github.io/Notes-task1/

We have Notes table and statistics table for notes categories (with quantity of notes per category).

You may:
add note - blue button on top,
edit note - first button in action column at the end of row,
set arhive/active status - second button in action column at the last of row.
remove note - last button in action column at the last row.

Also you may filter by notes status (active/archived/all) using drop-down select.

Thanks for watching.
